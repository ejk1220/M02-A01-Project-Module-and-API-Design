Object Oriented pattern: State Design Pattern

UI pattern: Fill in the Blanks
Package: Employee Portal   Classes: EmployeePortalUI

Run InitialPortalUI to start

Basic implementation of the state design pattern in the EmployeePortal methods to maintain the status of the login.
Still needed: backend to authenticate against user input, additional UI components past initial page, validation and testing.

The fill in the blanks pattern is implemented by the design of the user interface to get accurate input from the user. 
The portal access page simply includes username and password fields for authentication purposes.
